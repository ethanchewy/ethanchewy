### Hi there 👋

I'm a third-year CS Student studying at UC Berkeley who is graduating in May 2021. As a "non traditional" learner who had to develop much of my own study strategies to succeed in my coursework, my main passion at school is lowering the barrier of entry for learning CS. This semester, I'm creating content and teaching weekly sections for our Intro to CS course as a member of Computer Science Mentors and of the CS 61A course staff. Outside of teaching, I've recently created a platform with a few of my friends called <a href="https://connected.berkeley.edu/">Connect@Cal</a> for students to easily access resources they need from Berkely!

My favorite part about software engineering and CS is how you can create features that make users' lives much easier. On top of that, I love how you can apply engineering methodologies to create meaningful solutions to important problems in our society. 😊

In terms of my work experience, I've most recently worked on the [Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) on the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) Team as a Software Engineering Intern where I designed, implemented, and launched the composite run steps action feature. In the past I've interned at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) and [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/). For these work experiences, I worked with C#, Python, Go, and JavaScript to develop features for millions of people. 

My favorite language is Python at the moment but I'm slowly starting to enjoy C-languages after taking operating sytem and security classes. 

In my free time, I love playing volleyball and basketball as well as watching cooking videos.
