### Hi there üëã

I'm currently a Software Engineer at GitHub working on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

  When I started programming for the first time, I dove into various open-source repos on GitHub to learn how software development "worked" and eventually contributed to a few projects myself. On GitHub, I had a chance to collaborate and learn from developers across the world. Super surreal to work on a product that has helped me and many other developers learn and build!
