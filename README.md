### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a CS student at UC Berkeley who loves building software that tackles important and interesting problems.

I'm currently working on:
- creating more accessible educational content for CS 61A as an Associate and Content Mentor in [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/).
- leading the engineering team at [Connect@Cal](https://connected.berkeley.edu/) where we are creating new tools to help students get connected to personalized resources more easily such as our AI chat bot and case management system.

Some professional experiences I'm proud of:
- worked on the [Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) on the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) Team as a Software Engineering Intern where I designed, implemented, and launched the [composite run steps action feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-07-github-actions-composite-run-steps/)
- created several features at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) that helped users checkout more easily
- created a technical analysis site that analyzes over 19 cryptocurrencies over 100 bullish and bearish signals at [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/).

Throughout these experiences, I've worked with C#, Python, Go, PHP, and JavaScript as well as frameworks/technologies such as .NET, Flask, and Docker to develop features for millions of people. 

In my free time, I love playing video games with my friends, cooking, and playing basketball.
